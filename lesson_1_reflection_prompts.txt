How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Viewing diff provided a near side-by-side comparison with code differences
    that made finding the bug easy.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Having access to the entire history of a file would allow me to speed up debugging for programs.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    The obvious downside to manual commits are user error; an individual can
    save too much, too little, or not save at all. The upside is most commits
    should be meaningful vs what is currently possible with autosaving.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    In many cases when programming, changes will effect multiple files, so
    committing changes to a group allows individuals to look at one log rather
    than multiple ones. On the other hand, saving a repository of files with
    google docs at once doesn't make a lot of sense in most cases. The average
    user only makes changes to one file at a time and is unlikely to have files
    related to each other; supporting group changes would be a waste of
    resources.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Commands git log and git diff make it easy to view all changes to a
    repository. I can view progress and find bugs with code easily.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

     Version control allows me to make code breaking changes confidently because
     I know that I'll be able to revert back to a working version. Now that you
     have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I'm going to use Git for my software engineering project. Surprise Surprise
